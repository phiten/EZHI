"""Diagnostics for the APsystems EZHI integration.

Exists because almost every question about this integration is "which
transport, and what did the device actually answer" -- and the answer has so
far meant asking someone to paste log lines, which is how device serials and
WiFi credentials end up in public issue threads.

Everything identifying is redacted: the tokens and the account name, the
device id and serial, both MAC addresses, the SSID and the address the
inverter sits on. What remains is the shape of the installation, which is what
a diagnosis needs.
