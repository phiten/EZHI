"""Wire the MQTT transport to Home Assistant's own broker client.

The Home-Assistant-shaped half of the local MQTT transport, kept apart from
mqtt_api.py for the same reason ble_connect.py is kept apart from ble_link.py:
everything that talks protocol stays testable without Home Assistant, and
everything that talks to Home Assistant lives in one small file.

Import this lazily. The mqtt integration is a soft dependency, so an entry on
another transport must not pay for it.
