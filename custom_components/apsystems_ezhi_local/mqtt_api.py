"""Control the inverter over a local MQTT broker instead of the vendor cloud.

The device's cloud link *is* MQTT, and it validates nothing about the broker
it lands on -- no certificate pinning, no mutual TLS. Redirecting its DNS to a
broker on the local network therefore hands over the vendor's own control
channel, intact: the same identifiers, the same params, the same replies.
The wire format was verified end to end on 2026-08-10 against the real device
-- read a config, change a field, read it back, restore it, all of it with the
vendor cloud disconnected. That round trip was driven by hand against a
mosquitto broker, though, not by this module. So what is proven is the
protocol; this code path has not yet driven the device itself. Until it has,
treat a failure here as "our framing" before "their firmware".

Same method names as EzhiCloudApi and EzhiBleApi on purpose: the entities and
the coordinator call `coordinator.api.async_*` and must not know which
transport is underneath.

No Home Assistant here: `publish` and `subscribe` are handed in, the way
ble_link.py takes its connector. In production they wrap
homeassistant.components.mqtt; in the tests they are a fake broker. Nothing
below needs a real one.

Wire format and the capture it came from: mqtt_protocol.py.

        There is a second, independent reason not to substitute the push, found

        That is a property of the push, not of the transport. Re-measured
        2026-08-11 against a `get` reply over MQTT: all five offsets are
        populated there (75, 46490, 41397, 161, 143). An earlier version of

        poll_control_data() finds this by name through getattr and hands the
        whole cycle over when it exists. It exists only here, and that is the
        design rather than an omission: MQTT correlates replies by corr_id
        through self._pending, so any number of requests may be open at once.
        Bluetooth is a serial link -- the same gather would push nine requests
        into one wire -- so there the sequential path in poll_control_data
        stays.

        Why the whole cycle and not just the six new reads: the first refresh
        after startup has a 20 s budget (__init__.py, asyncio.timeout(20)),
        and nine sequential reads at the measured 5.05 s each would not have
        fit in it under any arrangement. In one gather the cycle costs one
        firmware tick -- measured 2026-08-11: ten
        identifiers fired together answered in 2.5-3.0 s wall clock across
        three runs, against 5.05 s for a single sequential read, because the
        one request waits half a tick for the next collection window and ten
        of them fall into the same one.

        Failure policy, matching the sequential path in three steps:

        1. Anything that is not an EzhiCloudError is re-raised, so a bug in our
           own framing surfaces instead of turning into an empty dict. gather()
           would otherwise collect it like any other failure -- and it is
           precisely a silent default fallback that the sequential path's
           `except EzhiCloudError` was written to avoid.
        2. A config failure fails the whole poll (the coordinator turns it into
           UpdateFailed): without systemMode we do not know what the device is
           doing, and every control entity would be showing a value it cannot
           vouch for.
        3. Everything else degrades to empty, because the entities built on it

        a change made from the vendor app in the meantime.

        The full merged field set goes on the wire, not just `changes`, even
        though the vendor app's own MQTT writes are partial. The merge
        semantics are the same either way (measured 2026-08-01, see cloud.py),
        and reusing the cloud builder keeps its typo guard, which turns a
        misspelled kwarg into an error instead of a silent no-op.

        Be precise about what that rests on: multi-field writes over MQTT are
        verified (the app sends them for some modes and the device answers
        200), and every individual field here is verified -- but this exact
        combination in one write is not. The one MQTT write we made ourselves
        was partial. So the first write from this transport has to be checked

        ``{"status": "1"}`` for off -- byte-identical to what
        ``ble_protocol.cmd_set_on_off`` builds (2026-08-08). MQTT carries the
        same property envelope: identifier, method, params and the four

        every other identifier. What was missing here was never the payload.
