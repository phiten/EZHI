"""The cloud API's surface, spoken over Bluetooth.

Same method names on purpose: entities and coordinator call
coordinator.api.async_set_*, so the two transports are drop-in replacements for
each other and nothing above has to know which one is active.

The validation is imported from cloud.py rather than repeated. The SOC window,
the discharge-protection floor and the power-limit-versus-schedule rule are
properties of the inverter, not of the wire it is reached over -- a copy here
would drift, and the copy that drifted would be the one guarding real hardware.
Two of those helpers are private to cloud.py; importing them inside the same
integration is the lesser evil against duplicating them.

# (Named "BLE-only" until 2026-08-11, when a `get outputData` over MQTT turned
# out to be answered the same way. The table lives here for historical reasons
# and because ble_api.py is already the HA-free home for field tables; the
# sensors themselves are created on both local transports, see sensor.py.)
# Which outputData fields become sensors, and how they present. Lives here and
# not in sensor.py so the table and its parsing are testable without Home
# Assistant; sensor.py maps the plain strings onto its enums (the string
# values ARE the enum values). unit/device_class/state_class come from the
# 2026-08-08 empirics against the real device
# (docs/ezhi-onoff-mqtt-session-2026-08-08.md).
#
# Two kinds of field live in this table, and the difference is the point.
#
# Measured: unit, device_class and state_class are filled in, because what the
# field means was established against the real device. A sensor built on a
# guess reads as truth, so nothing gets a unit on a hunch.
#
# Raw: the field is exposed under its wire name (batCT is called "batCT") with
# none of the three set. The meaning is exactly what is not known, and a name
# like "Battery Cycles" would be a guess wearing the clothes of a fact -- while
# "batCT" claims nothing at all. Diagnostic, and off by default: nobody should
# silently gain ten cryptic entities. Work one out, and it moves up into the
# measured half. (Decision 2026-08-11; before that these were left out
# entirely and reachable only through the ble_raw_get diagnostic service.)
